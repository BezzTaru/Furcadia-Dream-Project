Hello!

You're free to alter and redistribute my patches as you wish, provided you do NOT try to claim credit for the original patch or sell the original patch.

You can distribute edited versions of my patches as long as there's some sort of credit for the original patch.

You can use my patches for contest dreams or dreams you'll be selling.

You don't need to credit me to use one of my patches in your dreams, but it'd be nice!

You can contact me at linnyenator@gmail.com if you've got any questions.
